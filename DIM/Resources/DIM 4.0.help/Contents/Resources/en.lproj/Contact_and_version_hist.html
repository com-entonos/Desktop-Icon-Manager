<p class="Left Normal">Version History</p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 24 May 2025, v4.4- Change default behavior of Memorize to include any missing icons. Holding option key (⌥) changes "Memorize Icon Positions" to "Purge Icon Positions" which does forget missing icons. In other words, the new "Memorize Icon Positions" is the old "include Any Missing Icons" and the old "Memorize Icon Positions" is now the new "Purge Icon Positions". Changes also reflected in Dock menu.</p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 19 May 2025, v4.3.3- Right-clicking/holding Dock icon allows for fast Restore and Memorize.</p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 17 March 2025, v4.3.2- If DIM is running when number of displays change, automatically do Restore Icon Positions for the current Arrangement. Bug fix for processing command line arguements- now DIM forces itself to finish each command completely before moving onto the next command in the list (thanks to Github issue report from MeAndMyRhythmbox).</p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 31 January 2025, v4.3.1- If DIM is running when screens wake, automatically do Restore Icon Positions for the current Arrangement. Workaround for wandering drive icons on Desktop (thanks to Zack Wright).</p>
<p class="Left Normal">— 12 May 2024, v4.3- Holding the option key (⌥) changes "Memorize Icon Positions" button into "include Any Missing Icons" button. Finer control when importing Settings. Added command line arguments support for opening via Terminal. Update Help to reflect these changes.</p>

<p class="Left Normal">— 19 December 2019, v4.0.1- Bug fix for pre macOS 10.13 systems (thanks to Sergio Sisani). DIM could get confused if it was saving icon positions for the Desktop or a Finder window when adding a new arrangement.</p>
